# TCURawScripts
This part of the GitLab repo is the main asset for self-hosting Tea Cup Utilities. These shell files are all based on TCU's original (v1) build.
You can download these files and change them to your advantage, I don't offer support in any way regarding issues with these files.
They're stable as they are on this GitLab in the branch **"1.0"**, so issues you caused yourself are your problem :')

Thanks for using TCU <3

## The Build ##
This `.sh` files will deal with all installations for you!

**Please note that these files only support Linux, supported distros include; Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS.**

Use the following command to get started:  


`cd ~ && wget -N https://gitlab.com/Dok4440/TCUBetaBot/-/raw/1.0/TCURawScripts/linuxAIO.sh && bash linuxAIO.sh`


If everything went right, a menu will show up.
1. If you haven't installed the bot files yet, choose `option 1`  
2. If you're running TCU for the first time on your system, select `option 4` to install all prerequisites  
3. If you're looking to run TCU on pm2, select `option 6` to install the right version  
4. Last but not least, you'll have to fill in all the information you want to add for the bot to run, select `option 5`  


The `shell` files are pretty self explanatory, to start the bot; either select `option 2, 3 or 7`  
If you do happen to come across any problems running the bot, without having changed the `.sh` files or any TCU files that may affect your download, please contact Dok#4440 on Discord.
