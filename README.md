# Tea Cup Utilities  
Tea Cup Utilities is a Nadeko rework & is inspired by Mewdeko & Enjo. This bot and everything around its hosting, artwork & guides are open-source for everyone, under an MIT License. This means that you are free to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software that is listed **on this repository**. Furthermore, you are *more* than free to contribute to this project, meaning adding code, modifying & appending guides, suggesting features or perhaps calling out Dok is highly appreciated!

TCU comes in 2 additions;
1. You use the "public" bot, which is the one you simply invite through a [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=730786942416978021&permissions=8&scope=bot). This bot is hosted by Dok#4440.
2. Self-hosted TCU, which is the source code you download on **this repo** and run on your own pc! Self-hosting makes you the bot owner (which is not the same as server owner) and gives you access to bot owner-only features, like music, logs, currency generation, etc; or customizing the bot's name, avatar, playing status and more.

# Self-hosting
Self-hosting TCU isn't as hard as you *might* think it is. You simply follow a guide & you're set.  
There's a couple things we'll be addressing **in this README.md file**, all other "in-depth" information can be found in the [TCUGuide section](https://gitlab.com/Dok4440/TCUBetaBot/-/tree/develop/TCUGuide) of this repository.
