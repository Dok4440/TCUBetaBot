# Tea Cup Utilities  
Tea Cup Utilities is a Nadeko rework & is inspired by Mewdeko & Enjo. This bot and everything around its hosting, artwork & guides are open-source for everyone, under an MIT License. This means that you are free to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software that is listed **on this repository**. Furthermore, you are *more* than free to contribute to this project, meaning adding code, modifying & appending guides, suggesting features or perhaps calling out Dok is highly appreciated!

TCU comes in 2 additions;
1. You use the "public" bot, which is the one you simply invite through a [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=730786942416978021&permissions=8&scope=bot). This bot is hosted by Dok#4440.
2. Self-hosted TCU, which is the source code you download on **this repo** and run on your own pc! Self-hosting makes you the bot owner (which is not the same as server owner) and gives you access to bot owner-only features, like music, logs, currency generation, etc; or customizing the bot's name, avatar, playing status and more.

# Self-hosting
Self-hosting TCU isn't as hard as you *might* think it is. You simply follow a guide & you're set.  
There's a couple things we'll be addressing **in this README.md file**, all other "in-depth" information can be found in the [TCUGuide section](https://gitlab.com/Dok4440/TCUBetaBot/-/tree/develop/TCUGuide) of this repository.

## Setting up TCU On Linux, Windows & MacOS
### Linux

Use the following command to get started:  

`cd ~ && wget -N https://gitlab.com/Dok4440/TCUBetaBot/-/raw/develop/TCURawScripts/linuxAIO.sh && bash linuxAIO.sh`


If everything went right, a menu will show up.
1. If you haven't installed the bot files yet, choose `option 1`  
2. If you're running TCU for the first time on your system, select `option 4` to install all prerequisites  
3. If you're looking to run TCU on pm2, select `option 6` to install the right version  
4. Last but not least, you'll have to fill in all the information you want to add for the bot to run, select `option 5`  


The `shell` files are pretty self explanatory, to start the bot; either select `option 2, 3 or 7`  
If you do happen to come across any problems running the bot, without having changed the `.sh` files or any TCU files that may affect your download, please join [TCU's support server](https://discord.com/invite/bYGcGCCRr2).

### Windows & MacOS
TCU isn't officially supported on Windows & Mac *yet*. I will be updating this soon & add a guide to **this** README.md. Regardless of it's "unsupported" state, you can still self-host TCU on these operating systems. Have a look at the Linux guide & you *should* be able to figure this one out.
