# TCU_err_* list
This directory in the Guide branch is the complete error list of TCU. All errors logged **inside of Discord & thus as a return from TCU** will be listed here. That being said, these errors aren't messages that mean the bot is broken in any way. They simply mean **you have been doing something wrong**. Hence this error list.

### Why aren't these numbers adding up / making sense?
The errors are not numbered in terms of addition; it does not start with zero and adds up similarly. The numbering is based on the number of the line in the [ResponseStrings](https://gitlab.com/Dok4440/TCUBetaBot/-/blob/develop/src/TCU/_strings/ResponseStrings.en-US.json). This makes it easier to modify when you host the bot yourself.

### I'm still confused as to what the heck my error means..
No problem :), [TCU's support server](https://discord.gg/bYGcGCCRr2) is ready for you!
